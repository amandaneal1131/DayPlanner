In this project, I had to create a day planner from 9am - 5pm, the typical work day schedule. School started back up, and I am a teacher, so I put my school schedule with my first graders in their. I had to create time blocks, be able to type in them, and create a save button that is clickable. I also had code in to display the current date in the jumbotron. I added extra color for pizazz. I also had to create the planner to be able to change color as the hours passed from past, present, and future with differentiating colors. I think I did well on this, and it was fun!

Bootcamps Instructions:

Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the Moment.js library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

User Story
